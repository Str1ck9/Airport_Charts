# Airport Chart Retrieval Script

This repository contains an AppleScript for retrieving airport charts from Flight Aware based on an ICAO airport code input.

## Description

The script prompts the user to enter an airport code in ICAO format (e.g., KLAX, KJFK). It then constructs a URL to the Flight Aware website to directly access the charts for the entered airport and opens this URL in Google Chrome.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Simply download the `AirportChartRetrieval.scpt` file.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Google Chrome installed on your Mac, as the script opens the URL in Chrome.
2. Run the `AirportChartRetrieval.scpt` file using AppleScript Editor or any other compatible environment.
3. Enter the desired airport code in ICAO format when prompted.

## Compatibility

This script is developed for macOS with Google Chrome installed. It has not been tested on other platforms or browsers.
